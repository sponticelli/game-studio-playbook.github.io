## When to Use Track A

Use Track A when:
- Starting a brand new game project
- Your game hasn't launched yet
- You don't have player data or live operations to manage
- You're in pre-production, production, or preparing for launch

If your game has been live for 1+ years and you have operational data, consider [Track B](track-b/) instead.
