## About This Playbook

This workbook provides frameworks, checklists, and templates for game development teams. It's designed to be:

- **Adaptable** — Take what works, customize what's close, ignore what doesn't fit
- **Practical** — Focused on real problems teams face, not theoretical best practices
- **Technology Agnostic** — Principles apply across engines, platforms, and genres
- **Living** — Meant to evolve as your team and game evolve

The goal isn't to follow this workbook slavishly—it's to use it as raw material to build your own studio playbook.

_Version 1.0 — Like any playbook, this should evolve based on what works._
